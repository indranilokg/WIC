# Sample React application for step-up authentication

This example builds on the following base [sample](https://github.com/okta/samples-js-react). It adds a **Scenario** section to demonstrate different ways of step-up authentication in a OpenID Connect application.


## Prerequisites

Follow the steps defined [here](https://github.com/okta/samples-js-react/tree/master/okta-hosted-login) to configure the application and Okta


## Run the Sample

To run this application, install its dependencies:

```
npm install
```

With variables set, start your app:

```
npm start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

If you see a home page that prompts you to login, then things are working!  Clicking the **Log in** button will redirect you to the Okta hosted sign-in page.
