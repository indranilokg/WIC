# Step Up Authentication

Okta supports protocol-compliant [step-up authentication](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/step-up-authentication/main/)

[Here](react/README.md) is  a sample single page application for demonstrating the capability. The sample demonstrates the following scenarios-

* **Step up session**: MFA and elevate session for a set time period

* **Step up session - every time**: MFA every time user accesses a resource
  
* **Re-authenticate session**: Re-authenticate every time user accesses a resource
